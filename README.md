# Student Degree Program

This project demonstrates core C++ programming skills through the implementation of a simple student degree management system.

## Features

- Object-oriented design (classes, inheritance, encapsulation)
- Data validation and error handling
- Array and/or vector usage for data storage
- Basic algorithms for searching and processing student data
- Console-based user interaction

## Skills Demonstrated

- C++ class design and implementation
- Use of header and source files
- Dynamic memory management
- Input/output operations
- Data parsing and validation

## Usage

The program allows you to:
- Add and remove students
- Display student information
- Validate and process student data
